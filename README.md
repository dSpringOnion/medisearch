## 🚀 About The Project
This project was built to explore the challenges of **indexing and retrieving unstructured text data** in a medical context. It ingests raw JSON patient records (diagnoses, doctor notes) into an Elasticsearch engine and provides a real-time, fault-tolerant search interface for clinicians.

**Key Features:**
* **Sub-ms Latency:** Instant search results as users type.
* **Fuzzy Matching:** Handles typos in medical terminology (e.g., searching "Diabtes" still finds "Diabetes").
* **Hit Highlighting:** Visually identifies where the search terms appear in the unstructured notes.
